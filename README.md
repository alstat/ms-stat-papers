# MS Stat Papers
These are just some of the papers I submitted in my Master of Science in Statistics at School of Statistics, UP Diliman. These are not complete, some problem sets I submitted before were written in UP's blue paper. Also, the problem sets here are **not corrected versions**, that is, not accounting my mistakes. So take it with a grain of salt, and make sure to review it. One thing I am sure of, is that I passed. The intention here is to give an idea on what to expect, especially for those interested in taking MS Stat at UP Diliman. 

Lastly, I was not able to save my other problem sets from my other subjects like Nonlinear Regression, Image Analysis, Business Analytics and Machine Learning.
